###Scala Quick Start

#About Scala

- Comiled language that runs on the JVM
- uses type inference. This means all variables has a definite type - (but you don't neccsarily need to declare them)
- supports interop with Java and Clojure

#Scala Basics

- variables can be declared with as mutable or immutable using the "var" or "val" keywords
- traditional imperitive flow control works as expected - if, for, while, switch
- also supports functional methods like map, filter, reduce as well as pattern matching
- failure and empty states are represented with Option types, and are handled safely with for and flatMap
